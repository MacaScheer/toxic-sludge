# Rat Pipes

Rat Pipes is a 2-dimensional puzzle game inspired by Microsoft's Pipe Dream

# Background and Overview

The player must connect an entry pipe to an exit pipe through manipulating intermediary pipes. Rat Pipes differs from its inspiration in that all pipe-pieces are present on the screen at the start of the game, and must be rotated and shifted rather than freely placed. Additionally, instead of just sewage that flows through the pipes, there are rats that travel through the pipes searching for the smells on the other end.

Primarily built with the combination of following technologies: 

Javascript, CSS, HTML, Firebase

+ Rats will either bunch up and die, causing a clogged pipe, if the pipe is obstructed/blocked. Additionally, if there is an opening, the rats will escape and infest the   local city streets
